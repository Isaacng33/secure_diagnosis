Completed List
- Develop Basic NLP Pipelien to extract symptoms
- Build a Plaintext Model with no FHE Inference
- Perform FHE Inference on Plaintext Model 
- Attempted Training on encrypted data but it's not possible because Concrete ML only supports binary classification
- Build a Plaintext Model with Differential privacy 
- Perform FHE Inference on the DP Model
- Perform GridSearch to find optimised paramters for privacy budget of 0 to 5
- Built Streamlit Application for displaying workflow, performance metrics and privacy optimised parameters

TODO List
- Improve NLP Pipeline for better accuracy and reliability
- Test Privacy on DP and Non DP Model
- Neural Network

- quantify the security / privacy metrics (possibly performing attack on the model and get the sucess rate between plaintext and dp model)
- describe the data and the features of the data
- explain how fhe model is different from the normal model and how it accepts ciphertext
- talk about probems with fhe and introduce dp + fhe and the limitations
- possible future enhancement about accuracy and time
- explore dp and fhe theoritcally and matheematically
