Main Plan
Work solely on logistic regression but with additional security such as
having 4 different models 
1) Plaintext Model with no FHE Inference
2) Encrypted Model trained on clear data
3) Encrypted Model trained on encrypted data (Not possible because concrete ml dont support multi class)
4) Encrypted Model trained on clear data with differential privacy + Play around with parameters
5) Build Dashboard to shows the performance metrics of each model
6) GridSearch to find the optimised parameter for a 5 privady budget
7) Add LG_DP into streamlit once the optimise parameter is done

8) Perform Metric testing on privacy of non dp and dp model
9) Improve NLP Pipeline

If i have time i will implement Neural Network
