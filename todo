1. Build Frontend UI for side by side comparison
    Compare Plaintext vs. Encrypted Inference
    Viewing Ciphertext on UI
    View Graphs of Latency/Execution Time
        Time to encrypt feature vector
        Time to perform the encrypted inference
        Time to decrypt result
        Plaintext inference time
    Output Comparsion
        Disease predictions from all models (top-k diseases + probability)
2. Exploring multiple ML methods compataible iwth the dataset
    XGBoost
    Neural Network
    
3. Model Intepretability
    Showcase the feature coefficients to show which symptom influence the prediction
    to get Top contributing key symptoms
